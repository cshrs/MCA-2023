            <h3>Similarity</h3>

            <p> For this task we looked at the similarity of tracks across my portfolio theme. For simplicity and adherance to my theme, I have chosen to use the same tracks as Week 9. The graph below shows the differenes (and similarities) between the classic and rock tracks provided. </p>

<h3> Transcripting Wet Hands </h3>

<p>For this task I transcribed the piece Wet Hands by C418, which I took a look at in<a href="week2.html"> Week 2 </a>the resulting transcription is loaded below.

    <h3 class="special-h3">Original Transcription</h3>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>As you can see there is a drastic difference in the look of the notation within the piece. However, when I played the newly transcribed music in musescore; I found although it was different, I could still identify the similarity in the music and could easily tell that it was the same track. I noticed changes in the tempo of the track and many notes were changed into chords. Furthermore, the sheet music looks incredibly messsy and would be very difficult for a musician to perform. Overall, I would say this transcription offers little benefit for understanding the music data.</p>
