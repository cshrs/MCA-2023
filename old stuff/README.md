# Week 1
### Theme: Minecraft - Volume Alpha and Beta by C418 

### Some of the challenges to working with music / music data include:
- Access to scores, a lot of popular music might not have sheet music direct from the artist, often they are transcribed by a third-party by ear and uploaded to a website such as musescore.com. These might not be entierly accurate.
- Access to audio files, it can be difficult to obtain raw files for albums, especially in a world where audio is dominated by streaming services.

### How does your selected theme display some of these challenges?
- C418 do not have a collection of scores directly available to anyone, instead there are user-uploaded versions such as here: https://musescore.com/sheetmusic?text=minecraft


### Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.

The Minecraft - Volume Alpha and Beta are available anywhere you might find traditional music, such as physical copies (CDs / Vinyl), however it is also a video game OST: and is therefore presented within the video game, the music changes based on location (or dimension even) here is the explanation from the Minecraft Wiki:

>> "Music tracks can play at various points during gameplay. Some types of music are triggered by events, while others play randomly while certain criteria are met. The song "Alpha" always plays instantly during the credits, and the song "Boss" always plays instantly while the player is in the End if the ender dragon is undefeated or resummoned. Both of these tracks start playing in place of any already playing music. If the player is in the End and the ender dragon has been defeated, the normal End track plays 5 to 20 minutes after any currently playing tracks are finished.
>>
>>If the player is underwater in an ocean or river biome, random underwater tracks play randomly 10 to 20 minutes after any currently playing tracks are finished.
>>
>> If none of the previous criteria are met, but the player is in the Nether, a random general Nether track or a Nether biome-specific track plays, except warped forests, which don't have any music. If the player is not in the Nether and is currently in Creative mode, a random track plays (Creative only on Bedrock). If the player is not in Creative but is currently playing (i.e., not on the menu screen), a random general track plays. These tracks all play 10 to 20 minutes after any currently playing tracks are finished.
>>
>> If the player is on the menu screen, a random menu track starts playing after 1 to 30 seconds.
>>
>> Menu music stops playing in Java Edition when the player leaves the main menu and stops playing in Bedrock Edition when a loading screen finishes. Game music stops playing when the player quits the world. When the game is paused in Java Edition, game music also pauses and resumes when the player exits the pause menu. in Bedrock Edition, this is not the case because the game does not pause.
>>
>> All music as well as sounds in Minecraft are stored in the sound directory. However, the sound files are obfuscated and cannot be directly accessed. To get around with this, the sound directory can be extracted by the methods showed in Tutorials/Sound directory.â€Œ"

### _https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Music_

The intention of the soundtrack is to compliment the main form of media; the game itself, therefore it is easy to overlook the impact the music has on the overall experience. When in reality the soundtrack is incredibly important for many of the games players.

### Discussion: The aspects of the score that were not transcribed properly by the OMR engine
_[Wet Hands - C418.mscz](https://github.com/cshrs/MCA-2023/blob/master/Wet%20Hands%20-%20C418.mscz)_
- I managed to track down some free sheet music for the song 'Wet Hands' by C418 off the Minecraft - Volume Alpha album and Minecraft OST.
- The scan I found (https://sheetmusic-free.com/download/18001/), is very high definition which resulted in it being very readable by the OMR engine. This meant that when it was imported into the Musescore software, it managed to read the score very well. There were limited errors (mainly slurs and a couple of notes misplaced). After using this software and playing around with it, I've identified some of the following factors that might impact the quality of the import:
>> - The quality of the pdf: if the pdf is high quality the OMR engine will be able to read it more easily
>> - The complexity of the music: If the piece of music is simple, the OMR engine will be able to identify the notes more easily, and vice-versa.
>> - THe length: Shorter music means that there is less room for error.
