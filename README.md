# Week 1
theme: Minecraft - Volume Alpha and Beta by C418

'Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)? How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.'

Some of the challenges to working with music / music data include:
- Access to scores, a lot of popular music might not have sheet music direct from the artist, often they are transcribed by a third-party by ear and uploaded to a website such as musescore.com. These might not be entierly accurate.
- Access to audio files, it can be difficult to obtain raw files for albums, especially in a world where audio is dominated by streaming services.

### How does your selected theme display some of these challenges?
- C418 do not have a collection of scores directly from the artist, instead there are user-uploaded versions such as here: https://musescore.com/sheetmusic?text=minecraft
